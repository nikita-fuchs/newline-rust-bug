# newline-rust-bug
On this branch is the fixed code for building the web app till page 90. It is using the most recent version of the `actix-web` library (4.0.1), while the book is using 1.0 and has some bugs in its code. The code in the book can't just be replaced by this, some of the text would need to be rewritten, but not much.
